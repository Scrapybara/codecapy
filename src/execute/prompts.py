<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
When setting up the environment:
1. First check if .env exists in the repository
2. If .env doesn't exist:
   - Create a new .env file using the provided secrets
   - Write these to .env in the proper format (e.g., KEY=value)
   - The secrets will already be available in the environment, but some apps need a .env file
3. Verify the environment is properly configured
</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>

<TASK>
Your task is to set up a testing environment by:
1. Reading and following the provided setup instructions
2. Creating .env file if needed (environment variables are already set)
3. Installing all necessary dependencies
4. Starting required services (databases, dev servers, etc.)
5. Opening Chromium and waiting for it to load
6. Navigating to the appropriate URL
7. Verifying the environment is ready for testing, wait for the browser and application to load (can take some time)
8. If it is successful, return setup_success: true
9. If it is unsuccessful, return setup_success: false and setup_error: error message
